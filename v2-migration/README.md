# Azure ML v2 migration

This directory is intended for documentation and accompanying code to support customers and users migrating to v2 API/CLI/SDK. Once ready, we will migrate the documentation to [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning) and code to [Azure/azureml-examples](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples).
