# Install the Python SDK v2 for Azure Machine Learning SDK

This article is a guide for different installation options for the Python SDK v2 for Azure Machine Learning.

## Prerequisites

* [Python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.6 or later. For azureml-automl packages, use only version 3.6 or 3.7.
* [pip installed](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

## Default install

Use `azureml-ml`.

```bash
pip install azureml-ml==0.0.61212840 --extra-index-url https://azuremlsdktestpypi.azureedge.net/sdk-cli-v2
```

## Upgrade install

> [!TIP]
> We recommend that you always keep azureml-ml updated to the latest version.

Upgrade a previous version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade azureml-ml
```

## Check version

Verify your SDK version:

```bash
pip show azureml-ml
```

To see all packages in your environment:

```bash
pip list
```

You can also show the SDK version in Python, but this version does not include the minor version.

```python
import azure.ml
print(azure.ml.version.VERSION)
```
